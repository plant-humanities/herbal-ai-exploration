**To the well-affected Reader and peruser of this Booke, St. Bredwell Physition, greeting.**

Pen is the campe of glorie and honour for all men, saith the younger Pliny: not only men of great birth and dignitie, or men of office endued with publique charge and titles, are seene therein, and have the garland of praise and preferment waiting to crowne their merits, but even the common souldier likewise, as he, whose name and note may at first all obscure, may by egregious acts of valour obtaine a place among the noble. The schoole of science keepeth semblable proportion: whose amplitude as not abhorates, nor only, men of great titles and degrees, labour to illustrate, so whosoever doth, may confidently account of, at the least, his name to be immortall. What is he then that will denie his voice of gracious commendation to the Authors of this Booke? To every one, no doubt, there is due a condigne measure.

The first gatherers out of the Antients, and augmentors by their owne paines, have already spread the odour of their good names through all the Lands of learned habitations. Dr. Priest, for his translation of so much as Dodonaeus, hath thereby left a tombe for his honorable sepulture. Mr. Gerard, coming last, but not the least, hath many mates accommodated the whole worke unto our English Nation: for this Historie of Plants, as it is richly replenished by those fine mens labours laid together, so it could fulfill banewanted that new accession he hath made unto it. Many things hath he nourished in his garden, and observed in our English fields, that never came into their pennes to write of. Againe, the greatest number of these plants, having never been written of in the English tongue, would have wanted names for the vulgar sort to call them by: in which defect he hath been curiously carefull, touching both old and new names, to make supply.

And lest the Reader should too often languish with frustrate desire, to finde some plant he readeth of rare vertue, he spareth not to tell (if himselfe have seene it in England) in what wood, pasture or ditch the same may be seene and gathered. Which when I thinke of, and therewithall remember, with what cheerefull alacritie and resolute attendance he hath many yeares tilled this ground, and now brought forth the fruit of it, whether I should more commend his great diligence to attaine this skill, or his large benevolence in bestowing it on his countrie, I cannot easily determine.

This booke-birth thus brought forth by Gerard, is in forme and disposition faire and comely, every Species being referred to his likeliest genus, of whose stocke it cometh. So is it accomplished with surpassing varietie, unto such spreading growth and strength of every line, as that it may seeme some heroical Impe of illustrious race, able to draw the admiration of every man unto it. Somewhat rare it will be here for a man to move a question of this nature, and depart againe without some good satisfaction. Manifold will be the use both to the Physition and others: for every man delighteth in knowledge naturally, which (as Aristotle said) is in prosperitie an ornament, in adversitie a refuge. But this booke above many others will satisfie that minde, because it hath plentifull and delectable matter, which is the food of the minde, and doth it also in a fit and familiar and pleasing stile to every capacitie.

Now as this commoditie is communicated to all, so it may be esteemed a fruitfull endeuour, which is able to cause the minde to returne a benefit againe: that minde now beareth that Juvenall faith, *Scire volunt omnes, mercedem soluto nemo* (“All desire to know, none to yeeld reward”).

Let men thinke, that the perfection of this knowledge is the high advancement of the health of man: that perfection is not to be attained by those who neither can strong indeavour be accomplished without free maintenance. This hath not he, who is forced to labour for his daily bread: but if he, who from the flor houres of his daily and necessarie travaile stealeth, as it were, some fort of time, and putting it altogether, can bring forth so comely a garden, as this, to cover or pay the ignorance of many: what may be thought he would do, if, with publique maintenance did free him from private necessities, and unite his thoughts to be wholly intent to the generall good. O Reader! such men as thinke not to rob themselves to enrich others, but of their good names, to share out those visible riches and permanent sciences, may then become a proportionate heire. Although praise and reward joined as companions to the fruit of all endeavours, are (in part) desired of all men, that undertake losses, labours, or dangers for the publique behoofe: because they adde sweetnesse as it were unto vertue, and enable her more and more to refine herselfe: yet doe they not embrace that honour in respect of itselfe, nor in respect of those that conferred it upon them, but as they further encourage their paines.
