**Title and Heading:**

CAROLI CLUSII  
RARIORUM PLANTARUM  
HISTORIÆ  
LIBER PRIMUS.

**Translation:**

Charles Clusius  
The History of Rare Plants  
Book One.

**Body Text:**

*PLANTARVM, quas in variis peregrinationibus meis rariores observavi, historiam scripturus, ab arboribus eam auspicabor; sic enim ordo postulare videtur: deinde ad frutices, suffrutices & virgulta progrediar, quibus aliquot ἐπαίνου καὶ 'στίγκιμνια subjectam. Hæc autem omnia priore libro complecti animus est: reliquas stirpes in sequentes libros distribuam.*

**Translation:**

About the plants, which I observed as rarer in my various travels, I plan to write a history, beginning with trees; for that seems to be the order that is required: then I will move on to shrubs, subshrubs, and bushes, to whom I will apply some praise and criticism. I intend that the previous book [this book] covers all of this: I will allocate remaining plants to the following books.

**Text with the Illustration of "Draco":**

*CAP. I.*

*A. Paucis proditæ est huius arboris historia, eæque admodum mutila. Libuit itaque eam hic subiicere, & ab illa nostras Observationes auspicari; quandoquidem valde rara est, in nostra præsertim Europa, & Herbarijs dum hos Commentarios scribebam (ni fallor) incognita...*

**Translation:**

*CHAPTER I.*

Little is known about the history of this tree, and what is known is very incomplete. Therefore, I am inclined to present it here, and to begin our observations from it; because it is quite rare, especially in our Europe, and unknown in herbals when I wrote these commentaries (if I am not mistaken)...

*EST vero Draco (aptis enim nomen non invenio) proceræ arboris, Pinus procul intuentibus referens, adeo æquales, semperque virentes sunt rami. Huius truncus crassior, octavo aut nono cubito altus: ramos quarta parte minuscentes & nudos sustinet, qui in summo hic siti, in alios tres vel quatuor divisi sunt, adeo ut longius ab eo spectentibus, capite plena cubitalium foliorum, unciali latitudine, sensim in mucronem desinentium media costa denticulorum sanguine delineaturum.*

**Translation:**

It is indeed the Draco (for I cannot find a more fitting name), a tall tree resembling a pine to distant observers, because its branches are so uniform and evergreen. Its trunk is thicker and rises eight or nine cubits high, supporting branches that decrease by a fourth part, which are in the upper part, divided into three or four others, so that to those observing it from afar, it appears as if it has a head full of cubit-long leaves, tapering gradually to a point, with the central rib of the leaves outlined by a blood-like red color.

---

*in summo gelatines capita plena cubitalium foliorum, unciali latitudine, sensim in mucronem desinentium, media costa* 

*Truncus opacum sapeis, multis eminens, universali latitudine, sensim in mucronem desinentis, ut in Irideis foliis, venis decurrentibus et se in lateribus, mucronem plene representantem a rubris late in singulose volventem, & Aloes vel teris modo;... alios ex humorem roseum fundit, qui rubri lacrymæ denasfus, sanguis Dracionis appellatur, ob:*

**Translation:**

At the top, it holds clusters full of leaves a cubit long, about one inch wide, gradually ending in a point, with a central vein...

The trunk often impresses a shadow, prominent in many cases, with a universal breadth, gradually ending in a point, like in the leaves of irises, having veins elongating and rolling themselves on the sides, fully depicting a tip, and like a way of aloes;... it exudes rose-colored sap, which upon hardening is called dragon's blood because of its red drop-like appearance.
